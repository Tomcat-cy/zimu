伟大的汤玛士韦恩
wants to gut the Gotham Renewal Program,

11
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,460
创立的高谭市更新计划
established by the great Thomas Wayne.

12
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,290
裁减重要项目的预算

13
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,840
比如海堤以及低收户的生活补助

14
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,090
更新计划彻底失败 这城市进行更新了20年
The Renewal Program is broken. This city's been renewing for 20 years.

还有一名蒙面私刑者肆虐街头

25
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,780

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,150
我并不是说不需要改进

对 我正在看
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

32
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,800
她为什么还跟我平手？
Why is she still tied?

33
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,390
我以为最新民调会让我声势大涨
But I thought we were getting a bump in the new Post poll.

34
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,900
老实说 我不想再看了

…仍相信这城市能有所作为

37
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,120
我们需要一个领袖 不是拉拉队长
We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell, not a cheerleader.

38
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,870
我们需要一个讲真话的人

犯罪分子隐藏在混乱中

00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,070
像蛇一样伺机而动
waiting to strike like snakes.

61
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,680

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,810
更是一种警告
It's a warning.

63

恐惧
Fear...

65
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,660

你是怎么解出那些O？
Where'd you get those O's?

249
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,090
“他仍在说谎”只是部分密钥
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

250
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,590
只能解出H E L I S和T
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

251
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,720
我先试着找出双符号 解出字母
So, I'm looking for any double symbols to start, trying letters,

252
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,180
再看有什么结果
see where it leads.

253
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,100
有意思
That's interesting.

请他们进来 朵莉
See them in, please, Dory.

258
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,700
如果不是部分密钥呢？
What if it's not a partial key?

259
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,370
什么意思？
What do you mean?

260
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,290
如果是全部呢？
What if this is the whole key?

261
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,750
忽略没有字母的符号
Ignore the symbols we don't have letters for.

262
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,880
只用“他仍在说谎”的字母 别管其他的
Use only the letters from "He lies still" and leave the rest...

263
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,130
保留空白 我懂了
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

264
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,340
这样就无法破解大部分的密码
But that would leave most of the cipher unsolved.

265
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,260
我不懂这怎样能…
I don't see how that's gonna...

266
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,680
（驾驶）

267
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,270

Yeah, he's got a car.

269

看来当市长有很多好处
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

270
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,740
该从何找起
Where to even start?

271
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,660
不会太早下定论吗？ “驾驶”有很多意思
You sure this isn't a leap? "Drive" could mean anything.

272
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,740
你不信任我？
You don't trust me?

273
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,370
那你就信任我吗？
You mean like you trust me?

274
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,330
都两年了 我连你是谁都不知道
It's been two years now, and I don't even know who you are, man.

There.

276
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,860

真没想到
Oh, well, well, well.

288
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,920
顾家好形象没了
So much for family values.

289
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,250
她是谁？
Who is she?

290
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,920
不知道

他说要见企鹅人

Yeah, sure, there was.

632
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,980
他就是我们在找的老鼠
That's the rat we're looking for.

633

谜语人知道他是谁
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

634
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,360
找到老鼠 也许就能找到他
If we find the rat, maybe it'll lead us to him.

635
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,900
你从哪知道这件事？
Where are you getting this?

636

我有个线人今晚和检察官谈过

凶手的目标是与那个案子有关的人

639
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,580
我调查过那案子
I worked that case.

640
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,620
你不是他的目标
Riddler's not after you.

Maybe I, uh...

645
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:05,390
我去逼他把那只老鼠招出来
I go after him. Lean on him to give up the rat.

太危险了 他们和这家伙达成秘密交易

661
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,680
我没跟他有一腿
I don't have a relationship with him. Okay?

662

我不是很确定
I'm not so sure.

665
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,520
看来你惹恼了她
Looks like you upset her.

666
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:57,820
这算是好兆头吗？
Shall I take this as a good sign?

667
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:58,900
什么？
What?

668

有一场米契尔市长的追悼会

谜语人可能也不例外
Riddler might not be able to resist.

673
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,120

I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

677
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:24,010

678
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:27,350
“你是El拉特阿拉达”
"You are El Rata Alada."

679
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:29,390

是“鸽子”的俚语 知道是什么意思吗？
It's slang for "pigeon." Does that mean anything to you?

我以为你永远不会离开海滨公寓

719
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,370
你不觉得他救我代表什么吗？

那代表他发了希伯克拉底誓言

希伯克拉底誓言

我是无名小卒
I'm nobody.

806
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:15,310

01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:51,290
或者是他兼职当警察
Or he moonlights as a cop.

935
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,380
-老天爷 -快上
- Jesus Christ! - Go!

936
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:58,960
快去阻止他
Somebody stop him!

937
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:38,710
-他在那里 -站住
- There he is! - Freeze!

938
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:27,010
你可以打得轻一点吧
Could have at least pulled that punch, man.

939
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:28,760
我有啊
I did.

940
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,880
局长对你发出全面通缉令
Bock put out an APB on you.

941
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,220
你真的认为他也有份？
You really think he's in on this?

942
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:34,350
我不信任警察 你呢？
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

943
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:35,560
我只信任你
I only trust you.

944
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,980
缉毒组警察 怎会替法尔康的左右手卖命？
What's a narcotics cop doing with Falcone's right-hand man?

945
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:41,440
科森说警察保护老鼠 也许肯西是其中一个
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat." Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

946
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:43,320
你认为企鹅人是老鼠？
You think Penguin's the rat?

947
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,450
他的俱乐部是黑道窝 马龙尼根本就住在那里
His club caters to the mob. Maroni practically lived there.

948
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:48,490
企鹅人一定知道很多肮脏事
Penguin would have been privy to a lot of dirt.

949
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:49,910
检察官也是常客
DA was a regular too.

950
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:52,060
也许企鹅人惹上麻烦
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam

951
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,490
和警方合作是唯一的出路
and working a deal was his only way out.

952
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:55,790
拉塔阿拉达
The Rata Alada.

953
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:56,830
什么？
The what?

954
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:58,370
谜语人最新的谜题
Riddler's latest.

955
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:00,170
迷宫中的那组密码
The cipher in the maze.

956
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:02,750
意思是有翅膀的老鼠 就像个告密者
It means "a rat with wings." Like a stool pigeon.

957
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:05,960
企鹅也有翅膀
A penguin's got wings too.

958
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,930
我该再跟他谈谈了
Time for me to have another conversation with him.

959
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:11,680
谜语人呢？他会再杀人
What about the Riddler? He's gonna kill again.

960
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,970
全都有关联 不管怎样 这都是他的游戏
It's all connected. Like it or not, it's his game now.

961
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:18,230
想找到谜语人 就得找到那只老鼠
You want to find Riddler, we gotta find that rat.

962
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:22,690
肯西和双胞胎过去了
Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.

963
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:24,940
那是企鹅人
There's Penguin.

964
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:26,900
不知道袋子里有什么
I wonder what's in the bags.

965
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:29,780
你想行动了？
You want to move in?

966
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:33,120
先跟踪他们
Let's follow.

967
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:44,620
（高谭市东区清洁站）

968
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:55,180
他们停在海滨街的回收厂前面
They stopped at Waterfront Street. The recycling plant.

969
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:56,560
我到了
I'm here.

970
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,640
-你好吗？ -很好啊 你呢？
- How you doing? - Yeah, good. How are you?

971
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:02,230
很好 我们进去躲雨吧
Good, good. Let's get in out of this deluge.

972
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:24,000
这是制毒厂 滴毒
It's a drug lab. Drops.

973
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,290
有人来买货
This is a buy.

974
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:28,550
他们接收马龙尼的制毒厂 又开始重新运作
Looks like they got Maroni's operation up and running again.

975
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:29,800
也许根本就没有停过
Or they never shut it down at all.

976
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:30,760
你想说什么？
What are you saying?

977
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:33,970
高谭市警局史上 破获最大的贩毒案是骗局？
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history was a fraud?

978
01:17:58,330 --> 01:17:59,750
事情变得更复杂了
This just got complicated.

979
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,660
什么意思？
What do you mean?

980
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:09,050
怎么了？
Hey! What happened?

981
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:10,460
没事吧？
You all right?

982
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:22,980
你专偷危险人物的东西
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

983
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,730
天啊
Jesus.

984
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,310
这是你的癖好吗？
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?

985
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:29,150
三更半夜偷偷吓女生？
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

986
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:30,940
这是你在俱乐部工作的原因？
Is that why you work in the club?

987
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:32,740
为了干一大票？
It was all just a score?

988
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:36,620
我很想跟你交代每个细节 蝙蝠男
I would love to sit and go over every gory detail with you, bat boy...

989
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:39,910
但那些混蛋又回来了
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

990
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:52,170
老天爷
Jesus!

991
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:21,910
嘿 复仇使者
Hey, Vengeance!

992
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,790
你以为能抢我的钱吗？
You think you can come after my money, huh?

993
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:09,290
肯西 快去拿钱
Kenzie! Get the money!

994
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:15,960
嘿 搞什么？
Hey! What the...

995
01:21:11,150 --> 01:21:12,730
来啊…
Come on! Come on!

996
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:17,230
这家伙疯了
This guy's crazy!

997
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:20,700
来啊
Come on! Hey!

998
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:08,360
（逆向勿入）

999
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,160
闪边
Move!

1000
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:17,860
给我闪边
Get out of the way!

1001
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:30,080
快啊
Come on!

1002
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:39,920
给我闪边
Get out of the way!

1003
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,210
我干掉你了
I got you!

1004
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:21,790
终于干掉你了
I got you!

1005
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,210
去死吧 变态佬
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

1006
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:25,760
我干掉你了
I got you!

1007
01:25:42,210 --> 01:25:45,040
这算什么？扮白脸蝙蝠脸？
What the hell is this? Good cop, batshit cop?

1008
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:47,760
-谜语人是谁？ -谜语人？我怎么知道？
-Who's the Riddler? -Riddler? How should I know?

1009
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,130
事情很简单 奥斯
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

1010
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:50,630
警察逮到你的把柄
Cops caught you doing something.

1011
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,340
想封你的店 把你关起来
They were gonna shut you down, put you away.

1012
01:25:52,430 --> 01:25:54,300
你只要招出大咖就能保住小命
So you gave up a bigger fish to save your ass.

1013
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:56,510
你出卖了萨瓦托马龙尼
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

1014
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:57,810
断了他的滴毒生意
His drops operation.

1015
01:25:57,890 --> 01:26:00,350
但警察 市府官员 市长 检察官
But the cops, the city officials, the mayor, the DA,

1016
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:02,390
他们变得贪心 对吧？
they got greedy, right?

1017
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,060
破获史上最大贩毒案还不够
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

1018
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:05,900
他们也想接管滴毒生意
They wanted to take over the drops business too,

1019
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:08,320
但需要你这种小咖来打理生意
but they needed a minor league mope like you to run it.

1020
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,610
你不只替卡麦法尔康卖命 也替他们干活
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone. You work for them too.

1021
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,860
你们疯了吗？
What are you, crazy?

1022
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:14,030
所以你才杀死那女孩？
That why you killed the girl?

1023
01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:15,070
我没杀死任何女孩
I didn't kill no girl!

1024
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:16,950
我们知道她在零下44度工作
We know she worked for you at the 44 Below.

1025
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:18,330
但她发现了秘密 对吧？
But she got too close, right?

1026
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:20,620
从米契尔那知道你是老鼠 所以你就杀了她
Found out from Mitchell that you were the rat, so you killed her.

1027
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,660
但谜语人也知道了
But somehow Riddler found out too.

1028
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,670
他知道你太多事
He knows so much about you.

1029
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:26,790
-你一定认识他 -他是谁？
-You must know about him. -Who is he?

1030
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:29,590
你们真是一组二重唱
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.

1031
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:31,170
怎么不开始唱和音？
Why don't you start harmonizing?

1032
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:34,180
你们的小故事只有一个问题
There's only one problem with your little scenario, okay?

1033
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:35,590
我不是老鼠
I ain't no rat!

1034
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,510
要是被卡麦法尔康听到
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone would do to me

1035
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,680
知道他会对我怎样吗？
if he heard this kind of talk?

1036
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,930
你不想谈老鼠的事
Oh, you don't wanna talk about rats, huh?

1037
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:43,560
那就谈谈他对我的搭档做了什么
Maybe we can talk about what they did to my partner's face.

1038
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,190
哇靠 干嘛给我看？
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

1039
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:46,900
-他的头被胶带绑住 -拜托
-This was around his head! -Come on!

1040
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:48,900
张开眼睛
Open your eyes!

1041
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:54,410
你是El拉塔阿拉达吗？
Are you El Rata Alada?

1042
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:55,990
El拉塔阿拉达
El Rata Alada?

1043
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:57,910
对 有翅膀的老鼠 告密者
Yeah, a "rat with wings." A stool pigeon.

1044
01:26:57,990 --> 01:27:00,330
那不是你？这是迷宫中的符号
That's not you? The symbols in the maze, right here.

1045
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:03,000
说你就是El拉塔阿拉达
It says you are El Rata Alada.

1046
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,460
上面写“你是El拉塔”？
"You are El Rata"? It says that?

1047
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:05,750
怎么 有话要说吗？
Why, you got something to tell us?

1048
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:06,710
有啊
Yeah!

1049
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:08,420
那是我听过最烂的西语
It's, like, the worst Spanish I ever heard.

1050
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,340
什么？
What?

1051
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:11,090
是“La”
It's "La."

1052
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:12,460
La拉塔
"La" rata.

1053
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,970
这个谜语人是傻瓜吗？
What, is this Riddler stupid or something?

1054
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:16,930
天啊 看看你们俩
Jesus! Look at you two.

1055
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:19,600
世界最伟大的侦探
World's greatest detectives!

1056
01:27:20,010 --> 01:27:22,310
只有我知道“El”和“La”的不同吗？
Am I the only here knows the difference between "el" and "la"?

1057
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:23,480
真是够了
Jesus!

1058
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,060
不会讲西语吗？
No habla español, fellas?

1059
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:27,150
帮个忙 混球 闭嘴
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

1060
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,650
你认为他犯了错？
You think he made a mistake?

1061
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:30,940
他不会犯错
He doesn't make mistakes.

1062
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:32,070
有翅膀的老鼠？
A rat with wings?

1063
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:33,740
你知道那听起来像什么？
You know what that sounds like to me?

1064
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:36,990
一只臭蝙蝠 有没有想过？
A friggin' bat! Huh? You ever think of that?

1065
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:39,070
“你是El拉塔”
"You are El Rata."

1066
01:27:44,710 --> 01:27:48,580
“你是El”
"You are el."

1067
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:49,740
（输入URL网址）

1068
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:58,760
也许他犯了错
Maybe it was a mistake.

1069
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:00,010
他没那么聪明
Maybe he isn't as smart as--

1070
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:00,930
等等
Wait.

1071
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:05,680
那是他吗？
Is that him?

1072
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,400
我靠
Holy shit.

1073
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:11,930
（找到他了吗？那只老鼠？）

1074
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:15,850
（是）

1075
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:20,900
（也许吧 企鹅是有翅膀的老鼠？）

1076
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:25,950
（有意思）

1077
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:27,910
（你没看到大局）

1078
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:29,880
什么意思？到底是不是他？
What the hell does that mean? Is he or isn't he?

1079
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:34,710
（我得给你看更多 你才会懂）

1080
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:39,090
（下一个受害者是最大的谜面）

1081
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:44,260
（受害者？）

1082
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:47,470
（死了吗？）

1083
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:53,310
（就快了）

1084
01:28:53,470 --> 01:28:57,980
（这是你可以找到他的线索）

1182
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:33,460
也许你应该告诉她
Maybe you should have explained it to her.

1183
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:35,090

你和企鹅人有多亲密？还有法尔康
How close did you have to get to Penguin? To Falcone?

法尔康欠我那笔钱

我不想跟你说话
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1196
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:04,780
不行 我想知道 法尔康这种人为何亏欠你
No! I want to know why a guy like Falcone would owe you anything.

1197
01:38:04,870 --> 01:38:07,200
因为他是我父亲
Because he's my father!

1198
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:19,130
我母亲在零下44度上班
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1199
01:38:20,630 --> 01:38:21,930
就跟安妮一样
Just like Anni.

1200
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:26,640
我小时候她常带我去
She used to take me there when I was a little girl.

1201
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,060
去俱乐部？
To the club?

1202
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:31,980
对
Yeah.

1203
01:38:34,690 --> 01:38:37,570
她工作时我都躲在更衣室
I hid out in the dressing room while she worked.

1204
01:38:38,030 --> 01:38:39,780
常常在那里见到他
Used to see him there.

1205
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:42,530
他把我吓死了
He scared the shit out of me.

1206
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:47,950
我也不知道他为何用那种眼神看我
And I could never understand why he looked at me the way he did.

1207
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:52,330
然后有一晚我母亲跟我说他是谁
Then one night, my mother told me who he was.

1208
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:58,050
我母亲在我七岁时被杀害
When I was seven, my mother was murdered.

1209
01:38:58,710 --> 01:39:00,210
她被勒死
Strangled.

1210
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:04,090
一直没找到凶手 大概是俱乐部的变态佬
Never found out who. Probably some creep from the club.

1211
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:08,060
社工把我带走时
Anyway, social services came to take me away,

1212
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:10,310
他什么也没说
and he didn't say a thing.

1213
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:13,940
甚至不敢看我
Couldn't even look at me.

1214
01:39:17,690 --> 01:39:19,440
他欠我那笔钱
He owes me that money.

1215
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:22,650
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1216
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:24,950
我不该那么说你
For what I said.

1217
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,740
没关系
Oh, it's all right.

1218
01:39:31,290 --> 01:39:33,370
你觉得人性本恶
You assume the worst in people.

1219
01:39:34,290 --> 01:39:35,670
说起来
Which, well...

1220
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:39,880
或许我们没有那么不同
maybe we're not so different after all.

1221
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:47,090
面具下的你到底是谁？
Who are you under there?

1222
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:55,060
你在隐藏什么？
What are you hiding?

1223
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,270
你是…
Are you just...

1224
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:02,570
满脸疮疤吗？
hideously scarred?

1225
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:05,700
是啊
Yeah.

1226
01:40:12,950 --> 01:40:14,370
听我说
Listen to me.

1227
01:40:15,910 --> 01:40:18,790
我们若不挺身而出 就没人挺她了
If we don't stand up for Annika, no one will.

1228
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:23,580
这城市只在乎那些优越的
All anyone cares about in this place are these white,

1229
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:24,630
白人混蛋
privileged assholes.

1230
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:28,340
市长 警局局长 检察官
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

1231
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:29,680
还有汤玛士和布鲁斯韦恩
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1232
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,010
我倒觉得
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

1233
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:33,140
那神经病想杀这些人渣是对的
that psycho's right to go after these creeps.

1234
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:34,480
我以为你会站在他那一边
I think you'd be on his side.

1235
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,190
你为何说汤玛士和布鲁斯韦恩？
What do you mean, "Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1236
01:40:36,270 --> 01:40:38,230
你是住在山洞吗？
What, do you live in a cave?

1237
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:40,400
谜语人的最新目标 都跟韦恩家族有关

01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:51,160
你父亲应该要知道 法尔康会不择手段
Your father should have known that Falcone would do anything

1391
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:54,370
抓到他的把柄 然后利用他
to finally have something on him that he could use.

1392
01:49:54,450 --> 01:49:56,290
法尔康就是这种人
That's who Falcone is.

1393
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:00,750
你父亲的确犯了错
And that was your father's mistake.

1394
01:50:00,830 --> 01:50:02,880
当法尔康说出他干的好事
But when Falcone told him what he'd done,

1395
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:05,710
你父亲非常内疚
your father was distraught.

1396
01:50:06,590 --> 01:50:09,800
他告诉法尔康他要报警
He told Falcone he was going to the police,

1397
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:12,050
向警方坦白一切
that he would confess everything.

1398
01:50:13,550 --> 01:50:15,560
那天晚上
And that night,

1399
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:19,560
你父亲和母亲就被杀害
your father and your mother were killed.

1400
01:50:25,070 --> 01:50:26,820
是法尔康干的？
It was Falcone?

1401
01:50:32,870 --> 01:50:34,990
真希望我能确定
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1402
01:50:39,710 --> 01:50:43,250
也许只是街头混混干的
Or maybe it was some random thug on the street

1403
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:46,090
为了钱 一时害怕就扣下扳机
who needed money, got scared, and pulled the trigger too fast.

1404
01:50:46,170 --> 01:50:51,380
别以为我没有每天在寻找答案
If you don't think I've spent every day searching for that answer...

1405
01:50:53,140 --> 01:50:57,010
保护他们是我的职责 你懂吗？
It was my job to protect them. Do you understand?

1406
01:50:57,680 --> 01:50:59,480
我知道你一直怪自己
I know you always blamed yourself.

1407
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:02,100
但你当时还小 布鲁斯
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1408
01:51:04,270 --> 01:51:06,570
我看到你眼中的恐惧
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1409
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:10,360
但不知道该怎么帮你
but I didn't know how to help.

1410
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:12,950
我可以教你格斗技巧
I could teach you how to fight,

1411
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:16,990
但却没有能力照顾你
but I wasn't equipped to take care of you.

1412
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:18,910
你需要一个父亲
You needed a father.

1413
01:51:20,870 --> 01:51:23,290
但你却只有我
And all you had was me.

1414
01:51:25,670 --> 01:51:26,880
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1415
01:51:28,630 --> 01:51:30,550
别道歉 阿福
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1416
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:38,430
天啊
God.

1417
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:45,900
我从没想到我会再次感到恐惧
I never thought I'd feel fear like that again.

1418
01:51:48,610 --> 01:51:50,730
我以为我已经克服恐惧
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1419
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:58,410
我是说
I mean,

1420
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:01,750
我并不怕死
I'm not afraid to die.

1421
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:05,870
但我发现有一件事
I realize now there's something

1422
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,880
我就是无法克服
I haven't got past.

1423
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,550
这种恐惧
This fear...

1424
01:52:14,010 --> 01:52:16,970
深怕再次经历那种事
of ever going through any of that again.

1425
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:23,430
痛失一个我在乎的人
Of losing somebody I care about.

1426
01:53:14,030 --> 01:53:14,990
嘿
Hey.

1427
01:53:15,070 --> 01:53:17,820
我看到信号 不是你打开的？
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1428
01:53:17,910 --> 01:53:19,820
我以为是你
I thought it was you.

1429
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:34,300
-我找到他了 -我看得到
-I found him! -I see that.

1430
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:35,880
他抢走我的东西和手机
He had my shit and my phone.

1431
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:38,180
她被带走那晚打给我 留了言
She left a message the night they took her. She called me...

1432
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:39,970
高登 帮帮忙
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1433
01:53:40,050 --> 01:53:41,350
她抢走我的枪
She got my gun!

1434
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:44,390
-闭嘴 -把枪放下
-Shut up! -Put the gun down.

1435
01:53:45,930 --> 01:53:48,480
听我说 她打电话给我
I'm telling you, God damn it! She called me!

1436
01:53:53,070 --> 01:53:55,150
你自己听
Here. Listen.

1437
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:56,640
（安妮卡）

1438
01:53:57,110 --> 01:53:58,780
给我回来
Hey! Get back here!

1439
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:01,070
你想去哪？过来
Where you going? Come back here!

1440
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:03,240
喂 肯西 你干嘛？
Hey, hey, what are you doing, Kenzie?

1441
01:54:03,330 --> 01:54:04,660
你吓到她了
You're scaring her.

1442
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:06,450
对不起 法尔康先生
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1443
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:07,580
求求你
Please, please, please.

1444
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:08,960
别伤害我
Please, don't hurt me, please.

1445
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:11,710
别怕 过来
Hey, don't be scared. Come here.

1446
01:54:13,590 --> 01:54:15,630
我再问你一次
Now let me ask you again.

1447
01:54:16,340 --> 01:54:18,880
-米契尔跟你说了什么？ -没什么 他…
- What did Mitchell tell you? - No, nothing. He...

1448
01:54:18,970 --> 01:54:21,890
唐很爱讲话 我知道
Don liked to talk. I know that.

1449
01:54:21,970 --> 01:54:24,680
尤其是跟你这种正妹讲话
Especially to pretty girls like you.

1450
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:27,220
所以我才逼他拿走你的护照
That's why I made him take your passport...

1451
01:54:27,930 --> 01:54:30,810
好让我们好好聊聊
until we could have this little conversation.

1452
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:33,610
我只想离开这里
All I want to do is get out of here, okay?

1453
01:54:33,690 --> 01:54:35,820
我会销声匿迹 求求你
You'll never hear from me again, nobody will. Please, please...

1454
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:39,030
我保证会让你离开这里
We're gonna get you out of here, I promise.

1455
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:42,410
不过我得先知道
But first, I gotta know...

1456
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:44,830
他跟你说了什么？
What did he tell you?

1457
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:49,160
他只说 他们都跟你做了交易
He just said they all made a deal with you.

1458
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,920
他告诉你这件事
He told you about that, huh?

1459
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,290
我们的交易？
The deal.

1460
01:54:54,380 --> 01:54:59,300
他说你给了一些关于滴毒的线索
He said you gave some information on some drops thing

1461
01:54:59,380 --> 01:55:02,090
他才会当选市长
and that's how he became mayor.

1462
01:55:02,180 --> 01:55:04,550
他说你是个大人物
He said you were a very important man.

1463
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:05,760
是啊
Right.

1464
01:55:08,850 --> 01:55:11,020
好吧
Hmm. Okay.

1465
01:55:18,690 --> 01:55:20,030
放轻松
Just take it easy.

1466
01:55:20,110 --> 01:55:21,650
天啊 他在勒死她
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1467
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:24,780
放轻松
Take it easy.

1468
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,290
拉塔阿拉达
Rata Alada.

1469
01:55:40,050 --> 01:55:41,840
猎鹰也有翅膀
A falcon has wings too.

1470
01:55:42,170 --> 01:55:44,010
法尔康是老鼠？
Falcone is the rat?

1471
01:55:54,980 --> 01:55:58,150
法尔康替你们做事？
Falcone works for you guys?

1472
01:55:58,820 --> 01:56:01,360
市长？检察官？
The mayor? The DA?

1473
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:05,450
不
No.

1474
01:56:08,530 --> 01:56:09,830
我们为他做事
We work for him.

1475
01:56:10,830 --> 01:56:12,080
每个人都是
Everybody does.

1476
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:13,160
怎么会？
How?

1477
01:56:13,250 --> 01:56:14,830
通过更新计划
Through Renewal.

1478
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:17,000
更新计划就是一切
Renewal is everything.

1479
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:18,420
-更新计划基金 -没错
- The Renewal Fund? - Yeah.

1480
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,720
汤玛士韦恩死后 他们都像秃鹰一样抢这笔钱
After Thomas Wayne died, they all went after it like vultures.

1481
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:26,390
市长 法尔康 马龙尼 每个人都参一脚
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni. Everyone got in on it.

1482
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:29,850
那是行贿和洗钱的完美途径
It was perfect for making bribes, laundering money.

1483
01:56:29,930 --> 01:56:32,020
不受监督的庞大慈善基金
A huge charitable fund with no oversight.

1484
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:33,810
每个人都拿到一份
Everybody got a piece.

1485
01:56:33,890 --> 01:56:35,730
但法尔康想要更多
But Falcone wanted more.

1486
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:40,730
精心策划一个局 把马龙尼彻底整垮
So he orchestrated a play to take Maroni down big.

1487
01:56:42,150 --> 01:56:44,490
他出卖滴毒生意的线索
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1488
01:56:44,860 --> 01:56:47,570
让每个想抓他的人都升官发财
make the careers of everybody that went after him,

1489
01:56:47,660 --> 01:56:50,120
然后再要挟他们当他的傀儡
then install them all as his puppets.

1490
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:52,750
这场市长选举有个屁用
You think this goddamn election matters?

1491
01:56:54,370 --> 01:56:56,290
法尔康才是市长
Falcone's the mayor.

1492
01:56:57,250 --> 01:56:59,750
他当了20年了
He's been the mayor for the last 20 years.

1493
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:01,210
来吧 复仇使者
Come on, Vengeance.

1494
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:03,760
我们去杀了那个混账东西
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1495
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:06,090
-也把这个人渣解决掉 -天啊
-This creep too. Let's finish this. -Oh, God!

1496
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:07,010
不行
No!

1497
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:09,680
我们会逮到他
We'll get him.

1498
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:12,220
-但不是用这种办法 -没有别的办法
-But not that way. -There is no other way!

1499
01:57:12,310 --> 01:57:13,430
这城市都是他的
He owns the city!

1500
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:14,770
越过那道界线
Cross that line...

1501
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:16,850
就会变得和他一样
you'll become just like him.

1502
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:19,100
听我说
Listen to me.

1503
01:57:19,190 --> 01:57:21,070
别白白毁了你的生命
Don't throw your life away.

1504
01:57:27,610 --> 01:57:28,990
别担心 甜心
Don't worry, honey.

1505
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:33,540
我有九条命
I got nine of 'em.

1506
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:35,620
不 不要
No, don't! Hey, hey!

1507
01:57:36,910 --> 01:57:38,210
天啊
Oh, God!

1508
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:48,630
她不会活着离开
She won't get out of there alive.

1509
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:51,390
她杀了法尔康 就可能永远找不到谜语人
And if she kills Falcone, we may never find the Riddler.

1510
01:57:51,470 --> 01:57:52,470
我必须阻止她
I have to stop her.

1511
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:53,600
怎么不是我们？
Don't you mean "we"?

1512
01:57:54,930 --> 01:57:56,480
我得用我的方法
I gotta do this my way.

1513
01:57:56,810 --> 01:57:57,810
然后呢？
And then what?

1514
01:57:58,690 --> 01:58:00,060
照谜语人的话去做
We do what Riddler said.

1515
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:02,520
让老鼠曝光
Bring the rat into the light.

1516
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:40,520
告诉法尔康先生我想上去
Can you tell Mr. Falcone I'd like to come up?

1517
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:42,060
他今晚谁也不见
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1518
01:58:42,690 --> 01:58:44,020
告诉他跟安妮卡有关
Tell him it's about Annika.

1519
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:48,610
嘿
Hey!

1520
01:58:49,450 --> 01:58:50,860
看看是谁来了
Look who it is, huh?

1521
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:53,370
-抱歉打扰你 -没关系 美女
-Sorry to bother you. -Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1522
01:58:53,450 --> 01:58:55,450
我只想跟你谈一下
I was just hoping I could talk to you for a minute?

1523
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:57,080
没问题
Absolutely.

1524
01:58:58,830 --> 01:58:59,830
私下谈
Alone?

1525
01:59:16,390 --> 01:59:17,470
嘿
Hey!

1526
01:59:28,030 --> 01:59:29,230
我只是很担心
I'm just so worried.

1527
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:30,940
不知道她在哪里
I don't know where she is.

1528
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:36,080
我知道你是个大人物
And I know that you're a very important man.

1529
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:39,580
希望你能帮我找到她
I was hoping that maybe you could help me find her...

1530
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:43,460
她失踪了这么久 我开始…
because she's been gone so long, I'm beginning to...

1531
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:46,040
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1532
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:47,340
没关系
It's okay.

1533
01:59:47,420 --> 01:59:49,550
-真的很抱歉 -我懂的 拿去
-I'm so sorry. -I understand. Here.

1534
01:59:49,710 --> 01:59:52,590
没关系 我有面纸
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

1535
01:59:56,850 --> 01:59:57,760
法尔康先生
Mr. Falcone?

1536
01:59:57,850 --> 01:59:59,310
凡尼 叫你别烦我
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1537
01:59:59,390 --> 02:00:02,310
很抱歉 但我觉得你得看看
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think you're gonna want to see this.

1538
02:00:04,690 --> 02:00:06,190
不好意思 美女
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1539
02:00:06,270 --> 02:00:07,690
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

1540
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:24,080
他妈的
Holy shit.

1541
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:25,830
这段录音是由

那是什么？

撬东西的工具
Some kind of pry tool?

02:13:26,360 --> 02:13:29,280
是他用来杀死米契尔的凶器

谜语人要求见你 在阿卡汉病院

1696
02:15:42,250 --> 02:15:44,630
我说过我们会在地狱见
I told you I'd see you in hell.

1697
02:15:45,380 --> 02:15:47,210
你到底要我怎样？
What do you want from me?

1698
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:48,840
“要”？
"Want"?

1699
02:15:49,420 --> 02:15:53,050
你不知道我等了这一天有多久
If only you knew how long I've been waiting for this day.

1700
02:15:54,260 --> 02:15:55,600
这一刻
For this moment.

1701
02:15:56,640 --> 02:15:59,640
我一辈子都是无名小卒
I've been invisible my whole life.

1702
02:16:00,730 --> 02:16:03,350
看来我要出名了
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

1703
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:07,320
大家都会记得我
They'll remember me now.

1704
02:16:07,400 --> 02:16:09,230
他们会记得我们俩
They'll remember both of us.

1705
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:21,580
布鲁斯
Bruce...

1706

02:16:28,670 --> 02:16:32,420
布鲁斯
Bruce...

1708
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:36,720
韦恩
Wayne.

1709
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:50,400
那天我也在
You know, I was there that day.

1710
02:16:52,990 --> 02:16:56,370
伟大的汤玛士韦恩宣布要竞选市长
The day the great Thomas Wayne announced he was running for mayor,

1711
02:16:56,450 --> 02:16:58,830
做出一大堆承诺

1712
02:17:01,290 --> 02:17:05,540
一周后他死了 大家也忘了我们
Well, a week later he was dead, and everybody just forgot about us.

1713
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:09,630
只会成天关心可怜的布鲁斯韦恩
All they could talk about was poor Bruce Wayne.

1714
02:17:09,710 --> 02:17:13,380
布鲁斯韦恩这个孤儿
Bruce Wayne, the orphan.

1715
02:17:13,970 --> 02:17:15,510
孤儿
Orphan.

1716
02:17:21,180 --> 02:17:26,310
住在眺望公园的顶楼豪宅才不是孤儿
Living in some tower over the park isn't being an orphan.

1717
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:32,230
坐拥财富 瞧不起每个人
Looking down on everyone, with all that money.

1718
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:34,450
别想辩解
Don't you tell me.

1719
02:17:37,070 --> 02:17:39,740
你知道怎样才算孤儿吗？
Do you know what being an orphan is?

1720
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:42,700
30个小孩挤一个房间
It's 30 kids to a room.

1721
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:48,040
才12岁就为了麻痹痛苦而吸毒
Twelve years old and already a drophead, numbing the pain.

1722
02:17:49,750 --> 02:17:54,420
被老鼠啃着手指头 尖叫醒来
You wake up screaming with rats chewing your fingers.

1723
02:17:55,590 --> 02:17:58,760
每年冬天都会有一个婴儿夭折
And every winter one of the babies die

1724
02:17:58,840 --> 02:18:01,140
因为太冷了
because it's so cold.

1725
02:18:02,430 --> 02:18:05,020
但是不说这个了
But, oh, no.

1726
02:18:07,940 --> 02:18:11,110
说说这个 老爸满嘴谎言又死了的亿万富豪
Let's talk about the billionaire with the lying, dead daddy

1727
02:18:11,190 --> 02:18:14,110
至少钱能减轻痛苦
because at least the money makes it go down easy.

1728
02:18:14,190 --> 02:18:15,190
对吧？
Doesn't it?

1729
02:18:16,650 --> 02:18:18,700
布鲁斯
Bruce...

1730
02:18:19,740 --> 02:18:21,660
韦恩
Wayne.

1731
02:18:25,330 --> 02:18:28,420
只有他还没被我们杀死
He's the only one we didn't get.

1732
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:34,960
但我们杀了其他人 对吧？
But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?

1733
02:18:36,420 --> 02:18:40,300
那些老奸巨猾的伪君子
All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.

1734
02:18:43,470 --> 02:18:44,640
天啊
God.

1735
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:46,930
看看你
Look at you.

1736
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:51,060
你的面具超赞的
Your mask is amazing.

1737
02:18:51,150 --> 02:18:54,070
真希望你看到我戴面具
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

1738
02:18:54,150 --> 02:18:55,230
真的很讽刺
Ain't it funny?

1739
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:59,740
大家只想揭开你的面具 但却没抓到重点
All everyone wants to do is unmask you, but they're missing the point.

1740
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:03,240
你我都知道
You and I both know

1741
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:06,700
我眼前的才是真正的你
I'm looking at the real you right now.

1742
02:19:06,790 --> 02:19:10,420
我的面具让我完全做自己
My mask allowed me to be myself completely.

1743
02:19:10,500 --> 02:19:12,040
没有羞耻
No shame,

1744
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:13,960
没有限制
no limits.

1745
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:15,710
你为何写信给我？
Why did you write me?

1746
02:19:16,590 --> 02:19:17,590
什么意思？
What do you mean?

1747
02:19:17,670 --> 02:19:19,380
那些卡片
All those cards.

1748
02:19:19,470 --> 02:19:20,680
我说过
I told you,

1749
02:19:21,390 --> 02:19:23,300
我们一起做这件事 你也是计划的一部分
we've been doing this together. You're a part of this.

1750
02:19:23,390 --> 02:19:25,600
-我们没有一起做任何事 -当然有
-We didn't do anything together. -We did.

1751
02:19:25,680 --> 02:19:27,140
我们刚才做了什么？
What did we just do?

1752
02:19:27,220 --> 02:19:29,230
我要你让他曝光 你也做到了
I asked you to bring him into the light, and you did.

1753
02:19:29,310 --> 02:19:30,480
我们是最佳搭档
We're such a good team.

1754
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:31,560
我们不是搭档
We're not a team.

1755
02:19:31,650 --> 02:19:34,150
我不可能让他离开那里
I never could have gotten him out of there.

1756
02:19:34,230 --> 02:19:36,650
我没有蛮力 只有脑力
I'm not physical. My strength is up here.

1757
02:19:36,730 --> 02:19:39,900
我有每一块拼图 我有答案
I mean, I had all the pieces, I had the answers.

1758
02:19:39,990 --> 02:19:41,610
但我不知道怎么让大家知道
But I didn't know how to make them listen.

1759
02:19:41,700 --> 02:19:42,910
你给了我机会
You gave me that.

1760
02:19:42,990 --> 02:19:44,120
我什么都没给你
I gave you nothing.

1761
02:19:44,200 --> 02:19:46,790
你让我看到了可能性
You showed me what was possible.

1762
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:51,750
只需要恐惧加一点暴力就能做到
You showed me all it takes is fear and a little focused violence.

1763
02:19:51,830 --> 02:19:53,380
你启发了我
You inspired me.

1764
02:19:53,460 --> 02:19:54,960
你疯了
You're out of your goddamn mind.

1765
02:19:56,090 --> 02:19:57,170
什么？
What?

1766
02:19:57,250 --> 02:19:59,420
这都是你的想象 病态又扭曲
This is all in your head. You're sick, twisted.

1767
02:19:59,510 --> 02:20:00,880
你怎么能这么说？
How can you say that?

1768
02:20:00,970 --> 02:20:02,470
你以为人们会记得你？
You think you'll be remembered?

1769
02:20:02,550 --> 02:20:04,220
你只是个可悲的变态
You're a pathetic psychopath,

1770
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:06,470
-乞求关注 -不
-begging for attention. -No.

1771
02:20:06,560 --> 02:20:08,220
-你会在阿卡汉独自死去 -不…
-You're gonna die alone in Arkham. -No.

1772
02:20:08,310 --> 02:20:09,350
不…
No, no!

1773
02:20:09,430 --> 02:20:10,350
一个无名小卒
A nobody!

1774
02:20:12,140 --> 02:20:13,940
不
No!

1775
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:21,070
事情不应该是这样
This is not how this was supposed to go!

1776
02:20:25,740 --> 02:20:28,370
我全都计划好了
I had it all planned out!

1777
02:20:29,370 --> 02:20:31,370
我们在这里会很安全
We were gonna be safe here.

1778
02:20:31,750 --> 02:20:35,040
可以一起看这整件事
We could watch the whole thing together.

1779
02:20:35,130 --> 02:20:36,130
看什么事？
Watch what?

1780
02:20:36,210 --> 02:20:37,960
这一切
Everything!

1781
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:47,970
已经水到渠成
It was all there.

1782
02:20:50,140 --> 02:20:52,480
难道你还没搞懂？
You mean, you didn't figure it out?

1783
02:20:56,770 --> 02:21:00,690
你真的没有我想象的聪明
Oh, you're really not as smart as I thought you were.

1784
02:21:02,740 --> 02:21:04,820
我猜我高估了你
I guess I gave you too much credit.

1785
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:06,530
你做了什么？
What have you done?

1786
02:21:07,240 --> 02:21:12,120
什么既黑又青又死气沉沉？
What's black and blue and dead all over?

1787
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:16,790
你
You.

1788
02:21:18,460 --> 02:21:20,590
别以为你能阻止即将发生的事
If you think you can stop what's coming...

老兄 你不能碰那玩意

海水很快会倒灌进来 不可能来得及疏散人群

02:26:38,360 --> 02:26:43,200
这场地成为全市的最后避难所
as the venue becomes the city's shelter of last resort.

1848
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:48,580
然后就轮到你们上场
And that's where all of you come in.

1849
02:26:50,370 --> 02:26:51,830
（什么规格和口径的枪械？）

1850
02:26:51,990 --> 02:26:53,080
（用步枪最好）

1851
02:26:53,250 --> 02:26:54,540
（别忘了戴面具）

1852
02:26:55,010 --> 02:26:58,300
时候到了我已经会被逮捕
Now, when the time arrives, I will already be unmasked.

1853
02:26:58,380 --> 02:27:00,550
臭警察会拘留我
The pigs will have me in their custody,

1854
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:02,680
但没关系
but that's okay.

1855
02:27:02,760 --> 02:27:07,270
到时候就轮到你们上场
Because then it will be your turn.

1856
02:27:07,350 --> 02:27:11,230
你们会在那里等着
You'll be there, waiting.

1857
02:27:22,280 --> 02:27:25,200
该终结谎言了
It's time for the lies to finally end.

1858
02:27:25,290 --> 02:27:29,420
更新计划的虚假承诺？
False promises of renewal?

1859
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:30,580
改变？
Change?

1860
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:34,800
我们会给他们一个真正的改变
We'll give them real, real change now.

1861
02:27:34,880 --> 02:27:39,880
我们一辈子都窝在这破地方 受苦受难
We've spent our lives in this wretched place, suffering!

1862
02:27:40,340 --> 02:27:42,850
一直在想 为什么会是我们？
Wondering, "Why us?"

1863
02:27:42,930 --> 02:27:46,060
现在他们在死之前会想
Now they will spend their last moments wondering,

1864
02:27:46,140 --> 02:27:48,310
为什么会是他们？
why them?

1865
02:27:48,390 --> 02:27:50,440
打不通 电话断线
I can't get through! The lines are down.

1866
02:27:53,510 --> 02:27:55,600
（海堤溃堤 最后避难所 高谭广场花园）

1867
02:27:56,070 --> 02:27:58,240
嘿 道路封锁
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

1868
02:27:58,820 --> 02:28:00,450
我只是想出城
I'm just trying to get out of town, man!

1869
02:28:00,530 --> 02:28:03,410
小姐 海堤被炸毁 整座城市淹水
Lady, we got bombs going off. The whole city's flooding.

1870
02:28:03,490 --> 02:28:05,450
你得跟大家一起去广场花园
You're gonna have to go inside the Garden with everyone else.

1871
02:28:15,090 --> 02:28:16,750
-谁在指挥？ -我不知道
-Lieutenant, who's in charge? -I really don't know.

1872
02:28:16,840 --> 02:28:18,340
我们正在理清状况
We're just trying to get a handle here, sir.

1873
02:28:18,420 --> 02:28:20,260
好吧 听好了 安静
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

1874
02:28:20,340 --> 02:28:21,590
这是紧急状态
We got an active situation.

1875
02:28:21,720 --> 02:28:23,010
必须搜寻炸药
We need to sweep the building for explosives

1876
02:28:23,090 --> 02:28:24,300
把市长当选人带走
and get the mayor-elect out of here, now.

1877
02:28:24,390 --> 02:28:25,300
-她在哪？ -我带你去
-Where is she? -I can take you there.

1878
02:28:25,390 --> 02:28:26,220
走吧
Come!

1879
02:29:02,260 --> 02:29:04,640
-要是不关门麻烦就大了 -重案组
- If we don't close the doors we're gonna have huge problems. - MCU.

1880
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:06,100
海水开始倒灌
The water's already started to breach.

1881
02:29:06,180 --> 02:29:07,720
我以为这是最后避难所
I thought this was a shelter of last resort.

1882
02:29:07,810 --> 02:29:10,020
是能收容飓风灾民 但洪水来袭就没有用
Yeah, for a hurricane, but not if the whole seawall comes down.

1883
02:29:10,100 --> 02:29:11,930
我不会让市民在外面淹死
I am not gonna let those people die out there.

1884
02:29:12,020 --> 02:29:14,350
好 我去安抚群众 才能让每个人都进来
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd so we can get everyone in.

1885
02:29:14,440 --> 02:29:16,690
你在这里不安全 必须带你出去 蕾尔女士
It's not safe for you here. We need to get you out, Ms. Reál.

1886
02:29:16,770 --> 02:29:19,020
-我哪都不去 -我们遭到攻击
-I'm not going anywhere. -We're under attack, ma'am.

1887
02:29:19,110 --> 02:29:20,940
没错 这就是这城市的问题
Exactly! That's the problem with this city.

1888
02:29:21,030 --> 02:29:23,630
大家都不敢挺身而出为所应为
Everyone's afraid to stand up and do the right thing,

1889
02:29:23,630 --> 02:29:24,030
但我不是这样
but I'm not.

1890
02:29:24,110 --> 02:29:25,610
-失陪了 -女士
-Excuse me. -Ma'am...

1891
02:29:30,790 --> 02:29:34,250
大伙儿 请听我说
Everyone, everyone, if I could just get your attention.

1892
02:29:34,330 --> 02:29:36,630
拜托 请听我说
Please! I just need your attention!

1893
02:29:37,580 --> 02:29:38,910
（为高谭市带来真正的改变）

1894
02:29:52,520 --> 02:29:53,640
你没事
You're okay!

1895
02:31:24,570 --> 02:31:27,190
嘿 我要怎么上去？
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

1896
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:28,490
跟我来 长官
Follow me, sir.

1897
02:33:38,490 --> 02:33:39,990
不 没事了
No, no. It's okay.

1898
02:33:40,080 --> 02:33:41,120
没事了
It's okay.

1899
02:33:42,290 --> 02:33:43,330
没事了
It's okay.

1900
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:47,080
一切都结束了 结束了
It's done now. It's done.

1901
02:33:49,800 --> 02:33:51,130
结束了
It's over.

1902
02:34:46,980 --> 02:34:50,440
嘿…别激动
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1903
02:34:51,150 --> 02:34:53,480
别激动 冷静
Take it easy. Easy.

1904
02:35:22,050 --> 02:35:23,180
天啊
Jesus.

1905
02:35:33,020 --> 02:35:34,690
你是什么人？
Who the hell are you?

1906
02:35:38,900 --> 02:35:39,910
我？
Me?

1907
02:35:43,080 --> 02:35:44,490
我是复仇使者
I'm Vengeance.

1908
02:39:16,960 --> 02:39:19,250
11月6日 星期三
Wednesday, November 6th.

1909
02:39:22,460 --> 02:39:24,340
这城市被洪水淹没
The city is underwater.

1910
02:39:26,670 --> 02:39:28,430
国民兵正赶来
The National Guard is coming.

1911
02:39:30,720 --> 02:39:32,720
发布戒严令
Martial law is in effect...

1912
02:39:33,640 --> 02:39:35,270
但犯罪分子总是伺机待发
but the criminal element never sleeps.

1913
02:39:38,480 --> 02:39:42,190
抢劫和不法行为仍将在…
Looting and lawlessness will be rampant

1914
02:39:42,270 --> 02:39:44,820
没人去到的地方猖獗不止
in the parts of the city no one can get to.

1915
02:39:45,980 --> 02:39:49,700
可以预见 情况在好转前会变得更糟
I can already see things will get worse before they get better.

1916
02:39:52,660 --> 02:39:55,790
有人会趁火打劫 抢走一切
And some will seize the chance to grab everything they can.

1917
02:39:57,160 --> 02:39:58,540
我们将重建
We will rebuild.

1918
02:39:59,160 --> 02:40:00,620
不仅是重建城市
But not just our city.

1919
02:40:01,330 --> 02:40:05,550
也必须重建人们的信念 信任政府机构
We must rebuild people's faith in our institutions,

1920
02:40:05,630 --> 02:40:09,090
信任当选官员 信任彼此
in our elected officials, in each other.

1921
02:40:09,880 --> 02:40:13,220
我们将团结一心 学会再次相信高谭市
Together, we will learn to believe in Gotham again.

1922
02:40:17,560 --> 02:40:19,230
我开始看到改变
I'm starting to see now.

1923
02:40:20,690 --> 02:40:22,860
我在这里确实造成了影响
I have had an effect here...

1924
02:40:24,940 --> 02:40:26,860
但不是原本想要的
but not the one I intended.

1925
02:40:29,240 --> 02:40:32,280
复仇不会改变过去
Vengeance won't change the past,

1926
02:40:33,620 --> 02:40:35,990
我的过去 或任何人的过去
mine or anyone else's.

1927
02:40:38,410 --> 02:40:40,460
我必须成为一个英雄
I have to become more.

1928
02:40:43,540 --> 02:40:45,170
人们需要希望
People need hope.

1929
02:40:46,380 --> 02:40:48,590
知道有人在保护他们
To know someone's out there for them.

1930
02:40:52,380 --> 02:40:54,050
这城市充满愤怒
The city's angry,

1931
02:40:54,970 --> 02:40:56,350
伤痕累累
scarred,

1932
02:40:57,260 --> 02:40:58,520
就跟我一样
like me.

1933
02:41:00,640 --> 02:41:02,730
我们的伤疤能摧毁我们
Our scars can destroy us.

1934
02:41:04,100 --> 02:41:06,820
即便身上的伤口愈合
Even after the physical wounds have healed.

1935
02:41:08,440 --> 02:41:10,190
但我们若活下来
But if we survive them,

1936
02:41:11,700 --> 02:41:13,570
伤痕也能改变我们
they can transform us.

1937
02:41:15,450 --> 02:41:17,370
赐予我们力量
They can give us the power

1938
02:41:18,330 --> 02:41:19,830
韧性
to endure...

1939
02:41:21,210 --> 02:41:23,330
以及奋战的力量
and the strength to fight.

1940
02:41:26,250 --> 02:41:28,420
这是现场直播 大家都看到
We are live. As you can see,

1941
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:31,300
蒙面私刑者站在广场花园屋顶
the masked vigilante atop Gotham Square Garden

1942
02:41:31,380 --> 02:41:34,680
协助拯救数百名受害者的性命
helping to save the lives of hundreds of victims.

1943
02:41:34,760 --> 02:41:37,760
当急救人员急迫地帮助伤员
And now as first responders desperately scramble to help the injured,

1944
02:41:37,850 --> 02:41:40,390
一个神秘的蒙面人出现
a mysterious masked man emerges,

1945
02:41:40,470 --> 02:41:42,810
英勇地将受害者拉出天窗
heroically pulling the victims right through that skylight...

1946
02:41:42,890 --> 02:41:45,350
真可惜
Isn't that just terrible?

1947
02:41:46,730 --> 02:41:51,610
他 坏了你的好事
Him... raining on your parade like that?

1948
02:41:57,320 --> 02:41:59,330
有句话说得好
What is it they say?

1949
02:42:00,490 --> 02:42:02,660
“前一天你还意气风发
"One day you're on top,

1950
02:42:04,210 --> 02:42:05,870
隔一天
the next...

1951
02:42:07,250 --> 02:42:09,170
你就是个小丑”
you're a clown."

1952
02:42:11,550 --> 02:42:12,720
别气馁
Well,

1953
02:42:14,510 --> 02:42:17,340
你的下场还不算太糟
let me tell you, there are worse things to be.

1954
02:42:19,640 --> 02:42:22,310
嘿…别难过
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

1955
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:25,440
你干得很好
You did so well.

1956
02:42:29,940 --> 02:42:30,940

高谭市喜欢东山再起的故事
Gotham loves a comeback story.

1958
02:42:45,870 --> 02:42:47,250
你是谁？
Who are you?

1959
02:42:47,790 --> 02:42:50,210
这真是个好问题
Well, that's the question,

1960
02:42:51,460 --> 02:42:52,630
对吧？
isn't it?

1961
02:42:55,550 --> 02:42:57,930
猜个谜语
Riddle me this...

1962
02:43:00,390 --> 02:43:02,510
“拥有越少
"The less of them you have,

1963
02:43:03,270 --> 02:43:07,100
价值越高”
the more one is worth."

1964
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:14,280
朋友
A friend.

1965
02:43:36,420 --> 02:43:39,210
（谨在此纪念玛莉亚凯尔 1976年-2004年）

1966

你要走了
You're leaving.

1967
02:43:42,430 --> 02:43:43,510

Where will you go?

Bludhaven, maybe.

1972
02:44:00,280 --> 02:44:01,280
怎么？
Why?

1973

你要我留下来？
You asking me to stay?

1974

你明知这地方永远不会改变

卡麦死后 你的处境只会越来越糟

我得试试
I have to try.

1982

你最终会丧命的 你心知肚明

02:45:02,800 --> 02:45:04,220
我这是一厢情愿
Who am I kidding?

1990

你已经属于这里了
You're already spoken for.
